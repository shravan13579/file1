Docker 
	Docker is one of the tools that used the idea of the isolated resources to 
	create a container that allows applications to be packaged with all the 
	dependencies installed and ran wherever we wanted.

	Docker can only run on Linux machines this means I cant install Dokcer directly on Windows or any other OS.
	If I want install Docker on windows then I need to run a Linux VM in windows on top that I need to run Docker.

Virtualization (VM)
	- VM is way of running virtual OS on top a host OS using a special software called Hyperviser.
	- VM directly shares the harware of the host OS. 

					VM 					vs 			Containerisation 
	1. Virtualization at hardware level  		1. Virtualization at OS level 
	2. Heavyweight - consume more host 			2. Lightweight
	   resources 	
	3. VM useses hypervisor 					3. containerisation tool is used 
	4. limited performace - Boot up time        4. Native performace - usualy boot 
		is more which is in minutes 			   fast in seconds.
	5. Cosumes more storage 					5. Shres OS storage means only uses 
												   required storage.
	6. Supports all OS 							6. Supports on Linux

host machine 
	This is the machine in which docker is running 

Docker installation

1. Update ubuntu 
	sudo apt update 

2. Install support packages for Docker
	sudo apt-get install -y ca-certificates curl gnupg lab-release

3. Need add key to download Docker 
	sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings

	curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg	

4. Add docker packages to apt repository 
	echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null

5. Install Docker 
	sudo apt-get update
 	sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-compose-plugin


Assignment: 1. Create docker hub account 

Login to your hub account 
	docker login 

Just try 
	STEP 1: create directory in /home/ubuntu/jenkins_home 
	STEP 2: docker run -it -d -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 -v /home/ubuntu/jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home jenkins/jenkins:lts


Docker images 

To Download a images from docker hub / any registry 
	docker pull <image_name>:<tag>
	note: 1. The default tag will be always latest.
	      2. if we wont specify any tag latest will be considered 
To Delete docker image/images
	docker rmi <image1> <image2> .....

To Delete all the local images 
	docker images -q | xargs -I{} docker rmi "{}"
	docker rmi $(docker images -q)

To push a image to your repo 

		1. Create a tag which matches your repo syntax 
			docker tag <old_name> <new_name>

			ex: docker tag ubuntu:22.10 harshajain/test:1.0

		2. Push the image 	
			docoker push <username>/<image_name>:<tag>	

			ex: docker push harshajain/test:1.0


Docker container 
	A container is a set of isolated processes and resources. Linux achieves 
	this by using namespaces, which allows processes to access only resources 
	in that particular namespace, which allows having a process tree means set 
	of processes that is completely independent of the rest of the systems processes.

	Docker definition: A container is a standard unit of software that packages 
	up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably 
	from one computing environment to another.

To list all running containers 
	docker ps
	docker container ls 

To list all the containers (running, paused, stopped)
	docker ps 
	docker container ls -a

To delete a container 
	docker rm <conatiner_id>
	docker container rm <container_id>

To stop all running containers 
	docker stop $(docker ps -q)

To delete all stopped containers 
	docker rm $(docker ps --filter "status=exited" -q)

To create a container from a image 
	docker run -it -d --name <container_name> <image_repo>:<tag>

	Note:	-i: Interactive mode
		-t: tty terminal 
		-d: detached mode (creates container in background)
		--name: The name for the container to be created
		1. Always provide image name at the end of the command
